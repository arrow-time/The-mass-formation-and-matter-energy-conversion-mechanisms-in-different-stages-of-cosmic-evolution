# The mass formation and matter-energy conversion mechanisms in different stages of cosmic evolution

9.1.2  The mass formation and matter-energy conversion mechanisms in different stages of cosmic evolution:

## First stage of cosmic expansion: mass generation dominates.

According to this quantized elastic space-time model, mass is formed when compressed states are locked by the coupling of SEQ network spinors and the fixed chirality spin of SEQ . The formation of mass states depends on the degree of spatial compression and the intensity of SEQ network spinor. Since the universe as a whole is in a highly compressed phase during this stage, and SEQ network spinor is concentrated on a local zone, it is consistent that mass is formed. In the first stage, the entire cosmic space is generally in a highly compressed state, and during the initial inflationary period, the compression is even more pronounced. Due to the space network spinor--SEQ fixed chirality coupling locking mechanism (similar to the Higgs mechanism, introduced in Chapter 10), the highly concentrated spinor of local zone causes certain compressed spatial states to be locked into mass states. Therefore, mass generation dominates in this stage, especially during the early inflationary phase, when the spatial compression level is higher and better matches the compression required for mass state formation.

## Second and third stages of cosmic evolution: 

transformation from mass states to energy states dominates, with possible new mass state formation during the process.
In these stages, the universe as a whole enters a stretched phase. According to this model, mass states become unstable due to the stretching of the space itself. The conditions for mass state become weaker, leading to more mass states breaking down. During this phase, new elements—mass states—may be generated within massive celestial bodies.

## Fourth stage of cosmic evolution : the universe re-enters a compressed phase.

However, at this stage, the distribution of SEQ network spinor distribution has become more uniform, and the effect of the Higgs-like mechanism is weaker. Although new mass states may still form, the overall rate of mass generation is significantly lower than in the first stage.

## Fifth stage of cosmic evolution: 

repeated oscillations leading into thermal equilibrium oscillation.
As the network energy becomes increasingly uniformly distributed—an irreversible entropy increase process—the proportion of mass states in the universe gradually decreases through repeated oscillations. Eventually, all mass states are transformed into energy states, meaning the spin kinetic energy distribution of the SEQ network becomes uniform, and the universe enters oscillation in a thermal equilibrium state.
 
This mechanism, in which high spatial compression collaborates with space network spinor to generate mass, may also explain the observed anomalies in galaxy rotation curves. Specifically, the early universe featured a high concentration of network spinor. This intense network spinor concentration, coupled with the extreme spatial compression, facilitated the formation of mass. Consequently, the resulting mass structures and their surrounding space likely retain higher-than-expected spinor, which could account for the observed rotational dynamics in galaxies.

Dark matter formation is also dominated by a synergistic locking mechanism involving spatial compression states and a Higgs-like mechanism (space network spinor and SEQ fixed-chirality spin coupling), similar to the mass generation mechanism in the early stages of cosmic expansion. However, dark matter formed at a later stage than ordinary mass. The spatial compression level during this phase was insufficient to reach the threshold required for mass generation. Moreover, by this time, the increase in entropy had led to a more uniform distribution of space network spinor, reducing the strength of the spinor field in the Higgs-like mechanism to a level insufficient to lock high-compression states. This is the fundamental difference between dark matter and mass states. In essence, dark matter is also a form of locked spatial compression state, but with a much lower compression strength compared to mass states. Nevertheless, it still exerts a stretching effect on the surrounding space, manifesting as a gravitational field.

Why is there a global gravitational tension-restoring potential in the first stage of cosmic expansion, even though the entire space is in a compressed phase? Because the compression level within mass structures is significantly higher than that of the surrounding space, leading to a large gradient in spatial deformation, which gives rise to a relative tension-restoring potential — the gravitational potential.
This explanation is self-consistent and visually clear, especially in providing a concrete physical image and mechanism for the large-scale generation of mass states in the early inflationary universe.
