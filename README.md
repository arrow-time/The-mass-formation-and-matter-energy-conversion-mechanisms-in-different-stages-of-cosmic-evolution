# The mass formation and matter-energy conversion mechanisms in different stages of cosmic evolution

9.1.2  The mass formation and matter-energy conversion mechanisms in different stages of cosmic evolution:

## First stage of cosmic expansion: mass generation dominates.

According to this quantized elastic space-time model, mass is formed when compressed states are locked by the coupling of spinors and the fixed chirality spin of SEQ . The formation of mass states depends on the degree of spatial compression and the intensity of SEQ spin. Since the universe as a whole is in a compressed phase during this stage, and SEQ spin kinetic energy is concentrated on a few SEQ, it is consistent that mass is formed. In the first stage, the entire cosmic space is generally in a compressed state, and during the initial inflationary period, the compression is even more pronounced. Due to the spinor-SEQ fixed chirality coupling locking mechanism (similar to the Higgs mechanism, introduced in Chapter 10), the highly concentrated spin kinetic energy of some SEQ causes certain compressed spatial states to be locked into mass states. Therefore, mass generation dominates in this stage, especially during the early inflationary phase, when the spatial compression level is higher and better matches the compression required for mass state formation.


## Second and third stages of cosmic expansion: 

transformation from mass states to energy states dominates, with possible new mass state formation during the process.
In these stages, the universe as a whole enters a stretched phase. According to this model, mass states become unstable due to the stretching of the space itself. The conditions for mass state disintegration become weaker, leading to more mass states breaking down. During this phase, new elements—mass states—may be generated within massive celestial bodies.


## Fourth stage of cosmic expansion: the universe re-enters a compressed phase.

However, at this stage, the distribution of SEQ spin kinetic energy has become more uniform, and the effect of the Higgs-like mechanism is weaker. Although new mass states may still form, the overall rate of mass generation is significantly lower than in the first stage.


## Fifth stage of cosmic expansion: 

repeated oscillations leading into thermal equilibrium oscillation.
As the spin kinetic energy becomes increasingly uniformly distributed—an irreversible entropy increase process—the proportion of mass states in the universe gradually decreases through repeated oscillations. Eventually, all mass states are transformed into energy states, meaning the spin kinetic energy distribution of the SEQ network becomes uniform, and the universe enters oscillation in a thermal equilibrium state.


This explanation is self-consistent and visually clear, especially in providing a concrete physical image and mechanism for the large-scale generation of mass states in the early inflationary universe.
